#Web Page Implementation Project#

In this project, you will build a complete web page from scratch, without using any external libraries.
The goal is to apply everything you’ve learned about:

HTML structure

CSS layout and styling

Responsive design

Accessibility best practices

Following a designer’s mockup

You are given only the essential requirements—how you choose to implement the page is up to you.
This project allows you to think like a real frontend developer working from a UI design.

🎯 Project Objective

Create a fully functional, responsive, accessible web page that matches the provided designer file as closely as possible.

Your page must:

Look visually identical to the design file

Function across different screen sizes

Follow semantic HTML principles

Use clean, maintainable CSS

Include necessary accessibility attributes (labels, alt text, roles, aria-tag usage when needed)

No frameworks.
No libraries.
No copy-paste templates.
Just you, your code, and your creativity.

✔ Rules & Restrictions

To make the project realistic:

Do NOT use Bootstrap, Tailwind, or any CSS frameworks

You may use:

Vanilla CSS

Vanilla JavaScript (if needed)

Media queries

Custom fonts

SVGs and images

🧭 Recommended Workflow

Analyze the design file carefully

Break the page into sections (hero, features, pricing, footer, etc.)

Lay out the HTML structure

Add basic CSS for desktop

Add spacing, font sizes, colors

Add responsive rules

Test on mobile screen sizes

Perfect spacing to match the design

Validate with W3C tools (HTML/CSS validators)
